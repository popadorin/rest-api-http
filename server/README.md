--
#### Running the Node backend app (folder ```/server```):
Install Node. It comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm.
However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the
latest version.
For this:
- Run npm install npm@latest -g

- Run npm install nodemon -g and npm install mongodb -g

- Run npm install

Run
>node bin/www

Your server is up on http://localhost:3000/
